== Description ==

> This plugin requires <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" rel="nofollow">WooCommerce plugin</a>.

By Integrating the VePlatform into your WooCommerce webstore, you will have instant access to its suite of display advertising, remarketing and re-engagement apps designed to:

* Reduce your website's bounce rate
* Recover lost sales with email, display retargeting and SMS messaging 
* Increase conversion with real time onsite engagement 
* Reach new and existing prospects with digital display advertising
* Our applications work best when combined ensuring you don't pay more than once for a conversion generated, however we provide the option of using just one or more if you wish.

The VePlatform features the following apps:

= VeContact: Recover lost shopping carts =
* VeContact increases your sales by delivering real-time emails to customers who abandon at the check-out, enticing them back to complete their purchase with highly targeted and personalised content. Includes promo code integration and compatible across all devices.

= VePrompt: Increase website conversion =
* VePrompt re-engages your customers at the point they abandon your website and prevents lost sales caused by price comparison shopping, site usability or distraction during the purchase process. The VePrompt automated agent delivers real-time re-marketing messages. VePrompt can also deliver promotional codes to specific segments based on purchasing behaviour.
= VeAssist: Search optimization =
* VeAssist is an onsite product matching tool that directly tackles bounce caused by the disconnect that can exist between search and the products displayed on landing pages. Activated when a customer hits the back button to bounce, VeAssist interrogates your inventory and uses exact and nearest match logic to present the customer with enhanced product results, based on their original search engine query. Compatible with all search engines.

= VeAds: Dynamic display advertising =
* VeAds harnesses the power of customer and purchasing intent data to deliver successful advertising campaigns that meet all advertiser KPIs. VeAds helps you target and convert new audiences, on a vast scale, across all connected devices.
A successful digital advertising campaign uses a blend of prospecting and on and off site re-engagement to ensure that marketing dollars invested generate the best possible return.
1. Prospecting. Prospect for new customers by delivering bespoke display ads against contextually relevant content, on websites whose audiences match your target customers behavioural and demographic profiles.
2. Retargeting. Re-engage with users on and off-site who have visited your website but abandoned without purchasing or converting. This process ensures that you make the most of your advertising investment by driving users through the advertising conversion funnel.
